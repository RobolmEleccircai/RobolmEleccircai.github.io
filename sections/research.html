    <h1>Academic Research and Key Projects</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">My academic research at Wuhan University of Technology focuses on applying embedded systems and artificial intelligence to solve practical navigation challenges.</p>

    <!-- Research Project 1 -->
    <div class="research-card">
        <h2>Design of a Blind Path Guiding System Based on Semantic Segmentation</h2>
        <div class="tech-stack">
            <span class="tech-tag">Deep Learning</span>
            <span class="tech-tag">Semantic Segmentation</span>
            <span class="tech-tag">Image Processing</span>
            <span class="tech-tag">NVIDIA TensorRT</span>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> In my graduation project, I created a guiding device to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely. The system uses a lightweight semantic segmentation network to identify passable tactile paving and potential obstacles from camera input, providing voice instructions to users.</p>
        <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ported a lightweight neural network to an intelligent embedded system.</li>
            <li>Utilized NVIDIA TensorRT high-performance engine for model inference acceleration, enabling real-time processing.</li>
            <li>Proposed an image-processing-based obstacle avoidance algorithm to enhance navigation safety.</li>
        </ul>

    <!-- Research Project 2 -->
    <div class="research-card">
        <h2>Research on BeiDou-Based Swift Deployment System for Miniature AGVs</h2>
        <div class="tech-stack">
            <span class="tech-tag">BDS/GPS</span>
            <span class="tech-tag">3D Environment Construction</span>
            <span class="tech-tag">Autonomous AGV</span>
            <span class="tech-tag">Trajectory Planning</span>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Description:</strong> This research project involves developing a system for rapidly deploying automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in outdoor environments. We integrated BeiDou (BDS) and GPS signals to achieve precise positioning, enabling collision-free trajectory planning.</p>
        <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Used compound-eye cameras to collect environmental data and construct 3D visualized scenes.</li>
            <li>The system supports quick deployment of miniature AGVs to target locations beyond the visible range.</li>
            <li><strong>Patent:</strong> This work led to a registered software copyright: "BeiDou-Based Dual-Mode AGV Positioning System" (Registration No: 2023SR0232320)</li>
