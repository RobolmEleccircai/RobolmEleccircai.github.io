    <h1>Academic Research and Key Projects</h1>
    <p>My academic research at Wuhan University of Technology focuses on applying embedded systems and artificial intelligence to solve practical navigation challenges.</p>

    <h2>Design of a Blind Path Guiding System Based on Semantic Segmentation</h2>
    <p><strong>Research Focus:</strong> Deep Learning, Semantic Segmentation, Image Processing, NVIDIA TensorRT</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> In my graduation project, I created a guiding device to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely. The system uses a lightweight semantic segmentation network to identify passable tactile paving and potential obstacles from camera input, providing voice instructions to users.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ported a lightweight neural network to an intelligent embedded system.</li>
        <li>Utilized NVIDIA TensorRT high-performance engine for model inference acceleration, enabling real-time processing.</li>
        <li>Proposed an image-processing-based obstacle avoidance algorithm to enhance navigation safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Research on BeiDou-Based Swift Deployment System for Miniature AGVs</h2>
    <p><strong>Research Focus:</strong> BDS/GPS, 3D Environment Construction, Autonomous AGV Deployment, Collision-Free Trajectory Planning</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> This research project involves developing a system for rapidly deploying automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in outdoor environments. We integrated BeiDou (BDS) and GPS signals to achieve precise positioning, enabling collision-free trajectory planning.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used compound-eye cameras to collect environmental data and construct 3D visualized scenes.</li>
        <li>The system supports quick deployment of miniature AGVs to target locations beyond the visible range.</li>
        <li><strong>Patent:</strong> This work led to a registered software copyright: "BeiDou-Based Dual-Mode AGV Positioning System" (Registration No: 2023SR0232320)</li>
