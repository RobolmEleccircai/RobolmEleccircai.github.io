    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>Below are some of the key projects I've worked on, showcasing my practical skills in embedded systems, software development, and hardware integration.</p>

    <h2>1. Smart Home Automation Hub</h2>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> ESP32, MQTT, Python, Node-RED, Raspberry Pi</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Developed a custom smart home hub capable of controlling various IoT devices (lights, sensors, smart plugs) using a centralized system. Features included a web-based interface for remote control, integration with voice assistants, and data logging for environmental monitoring.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented secure MQTT communication between devices and the central hub.</li>
        <li>Designed a modular architecture allowing easy integration of new devices.</li>
        <li>Utilized Node-RED for visual programming of automation flows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Autonomous Line-Following Robot</h2>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> STM32 Microcontroller, PID Control, IR Sensors, Motor Drivers, C/C++</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Designed and built an autonomous robot that follows a black line on a white surface using PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control for precise steering. The project involved low-level microcontroller programming, sensor interfacing, and real-time control algorithm implementation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed efficient interrupt-driven sensor reading routines.</li>
        <li>Fine-tuned PID parameters for optimal performance on various curves.</li>
        <li>Designed a custom PCB for power management and sensor integration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Custom Wearable Health Monitor</h2>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Arduino Nano, PPG Sensor, Bluetooth LE, Android App (Java)</p>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Prototyped a wearable device that measures heart rate and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) using a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor. Data is transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a custom Android application for real-time visualization and data logging.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Implemented signal processing algorithms for robust heart rate detection.</li>
        <li>Developed a low-power BLE communication protocol.</li>
        <li>Designed a user-friendly Android interface for data display.</li>
    </ul>
